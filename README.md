## Description 

This project is a simple search interface built from Ileriayo's [markdown-badges repository](https://github.com/Ileriayo/markdown-badges). It was built using React to render each of the brand badges supported by [shields.io](https://shields.io/) so that a user can quickly search for and copy the markdown or svg img link for use in an application or readme. This is less of a generator and more of a search tool that doesn't necessitate scrolling through Ileriayo's large README in the repository.
